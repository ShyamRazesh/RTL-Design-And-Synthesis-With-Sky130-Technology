# RTL-Design-And-Synthesis-With-Sky130-Technology
This repository contains material from an RTL design workshop focusing on Verilog and the SKY130 open-source technology. The objective of the program is to develop a strong understanding of writing reliable RTL code that behaves consistently when implemented in silicon. The flow covers several key areas, including creating Verilog designs that follow proper coding practices, verifying functionality through functional simulation, building testbenches to check design correctness, performing logic synthesis, and finally running gate-level simulations on the synthesised netlist to ensure the design works as expected after synthesis.

# About This Workshop
Workshops provide a structured environment where learning, experimentation, and collaboration intersect. They help individuals of all experience levels — from beginners to professionals — to develop essential practical skills, understand emerging technologies, and connect with a like-minded community. The broader goals include enhancing creativity, boosting confidence, and equipping participants with knowledge that extends beyond traditional classroom or work settings.

# Prerequisites
 Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)
 Familiarity with Linux shell commands
 A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)
# Tools: 
github, iverilog, gtkwave, yosys
